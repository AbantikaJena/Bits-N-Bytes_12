<li>It resulted in massive unemployment of rural and semi-urban areas and artisans turned towards agriculture for their livelihood and the handicraft industry declined.</li>
<li> But now due to Globalization,integration of cultural system across the globe is easier.</li>
<li>Still lack of globalization due to improper infrastucture which links buyers directly to the manufacturer we are lagging in the  2nd largest sector after Agriculture i.e. the Indian handloom sector.</li>
